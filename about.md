I help businesses automate manual tasks one process at a time. I believe the best way to deliver software is in small, manageable pieces, getting those pieces in front of the customer as soon as possible.

I help software groups improve their processes utilizing management techniques, project tracking, version control, continuous integration, and unit testing.

I am the Co-Founder (with [James](http://www.jamessturtevant.com/)) of the [Augusta Polyglot Group](http://augusta-polyglot.github.io/). We get together once a month to teach and learn. One thing that makes our group unique, is that we focus on coding together instead of giving lectures.

I enjoy improving the quality of software by leveraging unit testing, version control and repeatable processes. I also enjoy's helping others discover the awesome career of being a software developer.

My current tools of choice are C#, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, AngularJS, Python, Git, SQL Server and Microsoft Azure.
