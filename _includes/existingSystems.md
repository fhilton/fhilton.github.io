Do you have an existing custom solution?

I have experience in technologies ranging from Microsoft Access to PHP and .NET MVC.

I can help you with 

- Documenting your existing system
    - If you have one person or one company that knows how to alter and deploy your software, that's a lot of risk
    - I can read code and create documentation on how to update and deploy your application
- Adding new features
- Improving performance
- Migrating to newer technology or Software As A Service (SaaS) for improved security, performance and maintainability
    - Just because something is a few years old doesn't mean you should throw it away. Often the best path is to lay out a plan and make small improvements until you have the solution you want
- Training and extra horsepower for your development team
