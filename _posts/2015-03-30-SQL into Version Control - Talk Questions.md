I recently had the privilege to give a [talk][d8c0da08] at the [Boston Code Camp][41767920] about getting SQL into version control.
<br>
<br>
The talk turned out to be quite successful, with a packed room and lots of questions.
I wanted to follow up with some answers to some of the top questions.
<br>
<h3>Top Questions from the Talk</h3>
1. Can you automatically deploy SQL Database Project changes when teh code is checked in?
2. What kind of validation is done when changing the target database version?
3. How do you deal with multiple, dependant databases, including using symbolic links?

<br>
I'll be turning the above questions into links to posts as I get time to answer the questions.
If you have any different questions on getting SQL into Version Control, add a comment and I'll do my best to give an answer.
