Back in 2013, [James Sturtevant](http://www.jamessturtevant.com/) and I started a [Mastermind Group](https://www.google.com/search?q=mastermind+group) that met every week for approximatly two years and grew to a total of 4 people.<br><br>
During those two years we both experienced explosive growth in our careers and more balanced personal lives. <br><br>

I've had a few people ask for more details about our group so I thought a blog post would be a good place to share the information. <br>

# What is a Mastermind Group?
My definition of a Mastermind Group is a group of people helping eachother accomplish a common goal. <br>
<br>
Examples of common goals are to succeed in business or to finish a graduate thesis. <br>
 In our case the common goals were to:

1. Live a balanced life.
2. Continue to improve ourselves in our careers and personal lives.

# Key Benefits
I believe the key benefits of a Mastermind are:

1. Keep each other accountable for the goals we are setting.
2. Provide a sounding board for difficult decisions.


# Mastermind Agenda
Each of our meetings had the following agenda:

1. Meet and greet.
2. Discuss difficult issues (if any)
3. Discuss the book we are reading.
4. Review completed goals and set goals for the next week.

If at any time one of us need help with something, we would susspend the agenda and spend the hour focusing on what the member needed. <br>
<br>
The key to a succcessful mastermind group is committement.  Everyone needs to meet EVERY week.  The whole group is based on the trust that members will show up and be dedicated.


# Setting Individual Goals
None of us wanted to work really hard climbing a ladder only to find that the ladder is leaning against the wrong wall. <br>
<br>
To make sure we were heading in the right direction, we developed a goal setting process that starts with brainstorming 101 goals and ends with actionable quarterly goals to which we would then keep eachother accountable.

# Want more Information?
