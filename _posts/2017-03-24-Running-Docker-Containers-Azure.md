There are multiple options for running Docker containers in Microsoft Azure. Below the options are broken out by the need to run an app in a single container or an app composed of multiple containers.

### Monolithic (Single Container) Apps
An application does not need to be built out of microservices to benefit from the advantages of containers.
Developing a monolithic application in a container gives the advantages of dependency management, portability and ease of deployment.
<br><br>
Options for running single containers in Azure:

* [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/)

    <br>Azure App Service now supports running Docker containers using Linux.  You can configure containers to be run using the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-linux-using-custom-docker-image) or [create a containerized application and deploy the container directly to App Service using Visual Studio](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2016/11/16/new-docker-tools-for-visual-studio/).
    <br>
    You can setup a continuous delivery pipeline for your App Service in Visual Studio Team Services using the [Continuous Delivery Tools for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VSIDEDevOpsMSFT.ContinuousDeliveryToolsforVisualStudio) extension.

* <strong>Azure VM - IAAS using ARM Templates</strong>

    <br>You can create your own VM using [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview) Templates and install Docker.  From there you can use [Azure VM Scale Sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-overview) to scale your service as needed.



<br>
Note that "Visual Studio Tools for Docker" is part of Visual Studio 2017 and available as an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MicrosoftCloudExplorer.VisualStudioToolsforDocker-Preview) for Visual Studio 2015.



### Service-oriented (Multiple Container) Apps
Containers really shine when it comes to building Service-oriented architectures.  Using services gives the ability to scale only the required parts of the application and allows developers to improve a single part of the system at a time.
<br><br>
While the above sounds great, the hard part is keeping track of all the containers.
Tools that help manage the provisioning, scheduling and monitoring of containers are called <strong>orchestrators</strong>.
<br><br>
You can use just about any orchestrator with Azure because you can manually create VMs and install whatever you like on them.  
<br>Installing and configuring orchestrators is a complicated process.  Microsoft has gone to great lengths to make configuring Orchestrators easier with the  [Azure Container Service (ACS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/)
<br>
<br>
Options for orchestrating containers in Azure:

- [Azure Container Service (ACS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/)

    <br>Azure Container Service makes it easier to setup orchestration by pre-configuring the hosting environment and deploying the orchestrator for you.  Select the orchestrator, the size and number of VMs and ACS takes care of the rest.

    <br>ACS currently supports (as of March 2017):

    - Docker Swarm (not to be confused with the new Docker Swarm Mode)
    - Kubernetes
    - DC/OS 

    <br>
    There are some great tutorials in the [Technical Community Content](https://github.com/Microsoft/TechnicalCommunityContent/tree/master/Open%20Dev%20Framework/Docker) repository on GitHub if you want to try out ACS.
    <br>
    You can setup a continuous delivery pipeline for your Azure Container Service in Visual Studio Team Services using the [Continuous Delivery Tools for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VSIDEDevOpsMSFT.ContinuousDeliveryToolsforVisualStudio) extension.

- [Azure Service Fabric](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-fabric/)

    <br>Azure Service Fabric is Microsoftâ€™s orchestrator that was originally used internally for services such as Azure DocumentDB, Azure SQL Databases and Skype for Business.  Service Fabric can be installed on premises or in a cloud provider such as Azure or AWS.  Service Fabric can run Linux and Windows containers. 


- <strong>Azure VM - IAAS using ARM Templates</strong>

    <br>As with the monolithic containers above, you can provision your own VMs and install your own orchestrator.

    There is a great example [here](https://github.com/tripdubroot/ContainerCamp/blob/master/labfour/deploy-docker-swarm.md) on how to use the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli) to setup and run [Docker Swarm Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) in Azure.
